GameMAG,"The Last of Us Part II is the high point of the PlayStation 4. The plot is controversial, but the game is the incredibly addictive adventure of Ellie, from which it is impossible to pull away from the opening and to the very end.",2020-09-13,90.0
PLAY! Zine,"Not everyone is going to enjoy the motives of The Last of Us Part II. But if you try and manage to accept the subliminal and not so subtle messages as a fact that the world has gone awry and that people have the need to have somewhere or someone to belong to as their own way out, then... You will witness the boundaries of gaming expand. You will witness a true masterpiece.",2020-09-05,93.0
,"If you loved the original for its great characters and well-paced story – stay away from this game. However, if you’re aching to sink into the depths of depression, or just want to cut some throats and burn some zombies – Part II will deliver. [Issue#247, p.72]",2020-09-03,75.0
,"Prepare for anger, fear, pain and disappointment. As clichéd as it may sound, Naughty Dog has reached a new, seemingly unreachable level of narrative design. The Last of Us Part II will hurt you in ways that no game has ever done before. This is a story you must experience. [08/2020, p.36]",2020-08-10,100.0
,"Brave, brutal, dark. The Last of Us 2 is not for everyone, a lot of things bother me about it, but it is still exceptional and worth playing. [Issue#304]",2020-07-22,80.0
Cubed3,"The Last of Us Part II's purposely bleak, pessimistic narrative spares no one, and offers a deeply engrossing tale of vengeance that grabs and never lets go. The production values, and overall attention to detail are insane, making one wonder what the developer will do when it gets its hands on the PlayStation 5. The gameplay and overall structure and pacing, while still not the thing that matters here, is thrice as good, making this a far more enjoyable experience, with a higher replay value from the original.",2020-07-20,80.0
PSX Extreme,"The Last Of Us II is an improvement on the first in nearly every way while still keeping what made the first game special. Story and characters are well done as expected and the game plays and feels amazing.  In keeping with the spirit of the first game, The Last of Us Part II has become one of the best games of this generation.",2020-07-19,90.0
Gamers' Temple,"If you enjoyed the first TLOU, you'll definitely find something to love in The Last of Us Part II. The game greatly expands upon just about everything that made the first game popular. The second game didn't get to me emotionally like the first game did, but it definitely has some heavy moments and the shock value is rather extreme at some points.",2020-07-13,85.0
Gamer Escape,"Part II is an unavoidable achievement in so many ways. The few things it doesn’t get right don’t bog it down as many seem to think. Collectively speaking, this game subverts expectations in ways that make it stand out head and shoulders above the rest. For that reason alone, you should feel confident that the money you drop on this game will be money well spent. The PlayStation 4 couldn’t have received a better swan song.",2020-07-06,90.0
LaPS4,"The Last of Us Part 2 is the finishing touch that both its history and the console itself deserve. A perfect game in all its aspects, with a story that captures you from the first moment and with unforgettable characters. Essential.",2020-07-02,98.0
GameCritics,"I finished The Last Of Us Part II feeling depressed, but not for the reasons the developer might have intended — Naughty Dog is an immensely talented studio with resources that many devs can only dream of, yet their achievements in presentation are held back by a lack of mechanical evolution and uninspired gameplay. The Last Of Us Part II is a journey worth tolerating for the sake of what it gets right, but when it comes down to it, I feel exactly the same way about it as I did about the first one — I wish it was a book.",2020-07-01,70.0

TheGamer,"The dystopian world created by the Naughty Dog team is one that I enjoy exploring and surviving in. For everything that The Last of Us: Part II gets right, though, I can’t help but feel like I just played through an extension of the same game from 2013. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, and like Ellie with Joel, I'm trying to accept the game as it is. Considering the impact that The Last of Us had on gaming, I guess I just expected to be blown away all over again.",2020-06-24,70.0
Noisy Pixel,"The Last of Us Part 2 has a lot to say about us as people after we connected ourselves to these characters in the first entry. The journey is one that is not for squeamish, but it was one that deserved to be told. As the player, we must once again witness the reality of this harsh world and those who are brought up in it...The Last of Us Part 2 is a masterclass in environmental design, and that cannot be overlooked. The messiness of the second act doesn’t overshadow how significant this adventure is.",2020-06-23,90.0
ZTGD,"Last of Us 2 is a hard game to critique. On one hand it sets new bars for performance capture and visual fidelity. Naughty Dog is truly head and shoulders above the rest when it comes to these areas. The world is impeccably detailed and the game is a true showpiece for visual fidelity. On the other hand it is just not fun to play at times. Whether it is the uncomfortable nature of what is happening or the fact that the game play feels like an afterthought to everything else included in the package. Combine that with a story that is sure to disappoint fans of the series and we have a mixed bag of emotions. There is no doubting the quality of this game, but I am not sure I needed or even wanted this sequel upon completing it.",2020-06-23,75.0
The Digital Fix,"Naughty Dog’s bravest, darkest masterpiece to date and one of the greatest games of this generation.",2020-06-22,100.0
GameCrate,"If you are the type of person who is going to raise a stink over Ellie being gay or Lev being trans or the game suggesting that self-centered individualism is toxic, and you know who you are, just stay away. This game isn’t for you...But for everyone else, this is one of the greatest masterpieces that the PS4 has produced. I’ll admit, I came into this title with a skeptical eye, ready to knock it down a peg from all the praise other critics had been giving it, but even with that pre-existing bias, I can’t deny that this is an amazing game, and you should play it.",2020-06-22,95.0
Forbes,"It’s stunning. It’s important. And it’s a deeply well-told story to the point where I genuinely cannot fathom why anyone who has fully beaten the game, not just heard the spoilers, not just watched a streamer snark their way through it or watched ripped YouTube cutscenes, doesn’t appreciate what it has achieved here.",2020-06-22,95.0
Riot Pixels,"The narrative, the bread and butter of The Last of Us, is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it has powerful moments that only the boldest studios can create, massive cliffhangers and it’s vicious towards the game’s main characters. Some scenes even caused internal conflict within me. Yet at the same time, Druckmann’s story is rife with plot holes, contrivances, teleporting characters and inexplicable behavior — dramatic tension takes precedence over structure and logic, and it looks very jarring at times.",2020-06-22,72.0
BaziCenter,"The Last of Us Part 2 shows us one thing, that the video games industry (unlike Cinema which is moving forward at a much slower pace) has a lot more unexplored potential. Part 2 raised the standards of video games so much, and in almost every respect, including gameplay, visuals, AI, and the [insane] amount of attention to detail, that you would wonder how this much progress on 7-year-old hardware is even possible, and the good news is that this is not the cap, and we can even have better titles in the very bright future of this industry. Just imagine what Naughty Dog (and other elite studios) can do with the next generation of hardware.",2020-06-21,100.0

Gaming Age,"With an enthralling story, complex characters, interesting gameplay and gorgeous visuals and audio, The Last of Us Part II is probably one of the most polished videogame experiences out there and it’s pretty easy to give it a great score and call it a day.

,"You can't argue that Naughty Dog hasn't thrown everything at this, and though its tendency towards maximalism doesn't always work, the results are frequently astonishing. This is the kind of game you get when you have unlimited budget and manpower and no one to say when - even if you wish sometimes that someone had. As a big-budget action game, then, The Last of Us Part II is almost without peer. As a sequel to that story, it is deeply, daringly, fascinatingly flawed. [Issue#347, p.88]",2020-06-18,90.0
The A.V. Club,"This sequel has more false stops than Return Of The King, and by its operatic and downright biblical finale, it begins to flirt heavily with pure bombast, with a self-seriousness as overgrown as any Bloater. But it’s usually smart to bet on Naughty Dog sticking the landing, and Part II invests so heavily in these characters—new but especially old—that by the time the actual ending finally arrives, it’s gutting in a wholly different way than the original’s.",2020-06-16,
Cheat Code Central,"The Last of Us Part II is difficult to play, and not because it is a poorly constructed game. Rather, it is a challenge because Naughty Dog forces people to take such a long, hard look at the terrible things people are capable of doing to one another. We can see people who we should hate and despise in situations where we pity them and can be appalled by what a character we like goes through and does to others. It is a bookend to its predecessor. People will be talking about The Last of Us Part II for years to come. They’ll be analyzing the story, if it needed to go to the lengths that it does, and considering the effect its world-building, gameplay mechanics, and accessibility options will have for years to come.",2020-06-16,96.0
New York Daily News,"That’s a disquieting echo throughout this game, for reasons that extend beyond this game, and, at times, that can make The Last of Us 2 emotionally challenging to play. But that’s not a reason to avoid this game; if anything it makes The Last of Us 2 that much deeper of a gaming experience. At times, you’ll wish you the game gave you options, permitted you to make choices for Ellie in critical moments.  Or maybe that lack of choice is the cold, hard lesson of it all.",2020-06-16,80.0
Digital Chumps,"Naughty Dog has crafted another game bursting at the seams with passion. Coming at the close of another console cycle, the studio proves its ability to evolve and defy expectations. The Last of Us Part II is no simple sequel. It is a fully realized vision of the world players were introduced to in 2013. Evolved gameplay not only asks players to be more tactical, it taxes them emotionally. But it is also a loving send off of beloved, grounded characters. Whether grabbing a pallet in water or carrying around a ladder, subtle nods exist to the first game, showing the studio takes to criticism and can improve.",2020-06-13,100.0
Game Over Online,"The Last of Us Part II takes everything that made the first game such a sea of change in the industry and amplifies it. We have seen Naughty Dog itself raise the bar and while this is easily their best PS4 game, I think the original game’s narrative ever so slightly tops the sequel even if the scope is larger with a more expansive cast. Part II plays better than the first, with more involved stealth and combat along with many quality of life improvements to make it a more enjoyable experience. In terms of all-time great games, it is right up there with the original and you can flip a coin on which is “better”. The original hooks you more right away, while the sequel is more of a slow burn that builds everything up just a bit more. The Last of Us Part II is Naughty Dog’s finest game yet.",2020-06-13,98.0
LevelUp,"Naughty Dog again proves that it can rise to expectations. With The Last of Us Part II, the studio maintains its prestigious status with a continuation that keeps intact the shades of the original, although it fails to completely overcome it. In parallel, it attempts to resolve a multi-faceted conflict that is impossible to cut, judge, or limit to spectrums as simple as ""good"" or ""evil."" Although character characterization is commendable, sometimes they feel without growth since they make the same mistakes over and over again. The outcome is grimly satisfying (in a sick and odd sense). The result is a visceral delivery supported by its combat, stealth, and world-building. Part II reaffirms how far the medium has come and the impressive craftsmanship behind its creation.",2020-06-13,95.0
British GQ,"So as the credits roll on my second playthrough I consider going back for a third, because this wonderful story does feels so good to play. It’s a game that’s never held down by the weight of its predecessor’s importance. Its writing and its performances feel pitch-perfect throughout, driven by the fact no movie or book or soon-to-follow HBO TV show could properly replicate the story it tells. It’s a video game and it could only exist as such. Now, just be sure you see it through to its incredible end.",2020-06-12,

Kotaku,"The first game’s story was polarizing; this one’s will clearly be as well. So many people worked on this game for so long, and at such cost, that I want The Last Of Us II to be more than the experience I had. It’s a visually beautiful game that feels distinct to play, and the story it tells and how it tells it, at the most basic level, certainly pushes the edges of what games have done before. None of those accomplishments elevated or redeemed it for me. Like the nature consuming Seattle, or the outbreak consuming humanity, its ugliness overshadowed everything else.",2020-06-12,
Polygon,"The Last of Us Part 2 depicts individual people who are instead ruthless, capable, yet self-absorbed, and whose perception of violence is limited to how it affects them and their chosen family members. They are almost unbelievably unable to see the bigger picture. Part 2 ends up feeling needlessly bleak, at a time when a nihilistic worldview has perhaps never been less attractive. Its characters are surviving, but they’re not learning, and they’re certainly not making anything better. Maybe the most surprising thing that The Last of Us Part 2 offered me was the surety that, while the game was made with great skill and craft, we are actually much, much better than Naughty Dog thinks we are.",2020-06-12,
The Verge,"Yet, I’m glad I pushed through — because those dark, disturbing moments are what make The Last of Us Part II so powerful. It’s not just a game about violence. It’s one that grapples with the impact of that violence and shows players the consequences.",2020-06-12,
Time,"While the violence of the first game served a compelling moral tale, the over-the-top bloodshed of Part II is all in service of a rather clichéd and tiresome lesson about the endless cycle of revenge. The banter that elevated the first game above mere dystopian fantasy is gone too, as Ellie often navigates this ultra-violent world on her own. It makes for a lonely, depressing experience at a moment when many of us are already feeling lonely and depressed...Still, it’s a rare AAA video game that will take any sort of risk — and Naughty Dog takes a lot of risks.",2020-06-12,

Without the immensity of an open world, it masterfully emulates the sense of freedom, and without the classic features of an RPG, it has allowed us to make the characters our own. Or rather, the other way around. It is an evolution for the genre in terms of technical aspects and an exercise in maturity in terms of how it deals with its themes. Despite some sloppiness, it holds the highest of standards and sets the mold for what should be the next generation of AAA games.",2020-06-12,100.0

For while it inevitably lacks that first game’s shock of the new, it instead trades on the player’s familiarity with its characters and their backstories to take them somewhere equally unexpected.

Guardian,"This is an unlikely comparison, but now that I’ve had some time to absorb The Last of Us Part II, it reminds me thematically of Shadow of the Colossus, another game about how consuming grief and anger can be. I was similarly poleaxed by that game’s clever manipulation of the player’s power, the way it also used the language of video games to make you think twice about your actions. The Last of Us Part II is another story that could only work as a game, the kind of challenging, groundbreaking work that comes along two or three times a decade.",2020-06-12,100.0
DarkStation,"There's no easy way to sum up The Last of Us Part II. It carries all of the flaws of modern video games but also tries to be so much more than that. It's a beautiful game, graphically and in terms of storytelling, but those qualities are coupled with a ridiculous level of violence and gore. Violence and gore that are the point and potentially overshadow the point. It's not perfect, but it's still amazing. It's the most well crafted third-person game that Naughty Dog has made so far, as well as the longest, with impeccable writing, acting, and pacing. Much like the first game and the PS3, anyone with a PS4 should seek out The Last of Us Part II. It is every bit as good as the first game, and together, the two games make Naughty Dog's most exceptional video game experience to date.",2020-06-12,100.0

If only more AAA games could choose for such strong choices despite the consequences, the media would surely be more interesting.

It’s the new high water mark for video game characters and I can’t wait for everyone to see just how special it is.

Polish and production values not only meet but exceed the level of Naughty Dog quality that players have come to expect.

Its combat is thrilling and darkly addictive, but this is a story about how violence changes people and rarely solves anything. The consequences of killing are made abundantly clear over and over again until, by the end, we simply no longer wanted to fight.

Carole Quintaine,"We wondered if The Last of Us 2 would manage to surpass the giant The Last of Us. It’s done, no problem! Powerful, visceral, this follow-up highlights the talents of Naughty Dog who tell a strong, deeply human story with real meaning. Beyond masterful gameplay and the sublime universe of the game, the player is pushed into his entrenchments, facing himself, with rage in the belly, tears in the eyes and head upside down. Simply a masterpiece!",2020-06-12,100.0
COGconnected,"The Last of Us Part 2 is uncomfortably real. It’s gritty, heavy, and polished to a mirror sheen. Even now, a week on from completing it, I’m feeling its weight. It’s far from what I anticipated, but crucially it did the work to get me invested. An astounding technical marvel, The Last of Us Part 2 deftly weaves diverse exploration and fun combat into the mix, resulting in a truly brilliant package.",2020-06-12,100.0

Daily Star,"The Last of Us Part II outshines the original in practically every way. The game takes level design, combat, stealth, AI and interactive narrative and uses each element to elevate the other. Unpredictable, intelligent and self-aware, this game seems to pride itself on digging into your head and staying there – allowing its themes and messages to grow and mutate long after the credits roll. Naughty Dog knows just when to take your tools off you, remove the safety blanket and provoke you. It weaves inconsistent pacing and tension together masterfully to leave you as scared and vulnerable as its protagonists. This is a game that’s going to be talked about for a long time to come, and with good reason. A masterpiece.",2020-06-12,100.0
Digitally Downloaded,"I really loved the moment-to-moment movement of The Last of Us 2. I enjoyed plotting my way around, trying to minimise the amount of combat I needed to get into. I loved the rhythms and structure of the game, and as one of the final big shows for the PlayStation 4, it makes me wonder why we’re even bothering with a “next generation.”",2020-06-12,100.0
EGM,"Whether or not you consider The Last of Us Part II to be a worthwhile continuation of Joel and Ellie’s story, there’s no doubt that Naughty Dog has crafted a sequel that’s every bit as ambitious and well-considered as the original, with quite possibly the best stealth-action gameplay realized to date.",2020-06-12,100.0

Areajugones,"The Last of Us 2 is a masterpiece that not only manages to stand toe to toe with the first entry, it even surpasses it. The story of TLOU2 introduces a narrative concept which is very different from what we are used to, and it keeps on surprising us again and again. Furthermore, its landscapes, gameplay and visuals will forever remain with the players as the highest expression of videogames ever achieved on the PlayStation 4.",2020-06-12,100.0
Hobby Consolas,"After going through the valley of the shadow of death, The Last of Us Part II comes out as a wayfaring stranger from future days. It's a technical and narrative triumph that defies some of the most basic concepts of the video game. It's brutally beautiful and painfully violent, it's capable of the best and the worst. It's a masterpiece.",2020-06-12,99.0

Millenium,"To put it simply, The Last of Us 2 succeeds in achieving excellence in everything it does. Its poignant story, with strong themes, is well-paced, the gameplay thoroughly reworked, allowing the rage of its heroine to express itself, all wrapped in the most elegant of bows. Far beyond the simple, unfounded sequel that some feared, TLOU2 marks the expansion of the universe linked to Ellie and Joel's first adventures thanks to a new, emotionally-charged and challenging quest. The latest Naughty Dog title undoubtedly ranks among the best titles on the PS4.",2020-06-12,95.0

Press Start Australia,"Though it’s destined to displease those who built Ellie and Joel up as infallible, as an observation of impermanence, tribalism and the terrible cycle of violence that exists at the centre of what’s left of the human experience in this world. The Last of Us Part II is a spectacular sequel, it’s a brave and unexpected direction for the series, expanding on the world both narratively and mechanically, producing a far sounder and rounded experience that never falters or gets in the way of the game’s clear storytelling strength.",2020-06-12,95.0

Meristation,"The Last of Us Part II marks a real turning point from a narrative perspective on videogames. The game is arguably better than the previous entry in a mechanical perspective; both its level design, the animations and combat system have been much improved. Ellie is the cornerstone of the story, and we can feel through her the real message that Naughty Dog is telling us during the adventure. Despite its simple puzzles and some overly-long sections, the title shines in every single aspect. TLOU2 is brilliant.",2020-06-12,93.0
AusGamers,"It’s not for the faint of heart, and takes the post-apocalyptic formula to new brutality heights, but you’ll have dreaded fun while plotting your course both through the game, and for revenge. After all, it’s a dish best served cold, and more often than not you’ll be shivering outside in the rain-drenched black of night, bruised, bloodied and battered. Staring at the last two rounds in your weapon, wishing you had a fuse for your near-completed molotov while hearing the echo-location clicks of the poor bastards swaying in the corner, the pandemic turned into living purple 1-Down mushrooms.",2020-06-12,92.0

IGN Spain,"Without leaving the same taste in you mouth as the masterpiece that is its first installment, The Last of Us - Part 2 is an excellent game that will make us reflect on the value of loss in a cruel and violent world so perfectly reflected that the player is not comfortable performing certain crude actions. Undoubtedly, Naughty Dog again puts the finishing touch on a PlayStation generation.",2020-06-12,90.0
Shacknews,"The Last of Us Part 2 is not for everyone. It is a dark and riveting experiment. A symphony of madness, revenge, and brutality. It is the song of humanity’s greatest darkness, and an absolute delight to partake in. The fine folks at Naughty Dog have outdone themselves this time around. The clever blend of cinematics and gameplay all come together perfectly to create an unforgettable experience that rivals some of the greatest classics in American cinema. All that’s left to do now is see it for yourself.",2020-06-12,90.0
USgamer,"The Last of Us Part 2 is an outstanding action game; a darker, more introspective follow-up that seeks to challenge the conventions of big-budget action games. In this it's not always successful, but its execution is impeccable, and its story proves an appropriate bookend to the story of Joel and Ellie. In short, it's some of Naughty Dog's best work.",2020-06-12,90.0
VideoGamer,"Where it succeeds isn’t in how close it scrapes to the level of prestige TV, or to films. Its coup is not, “Look how closely we can make games resemble highbrow art.” It’s more, “Look what previously fenced-off realms we can get interactivity into.""",2020-06-12,90.0

Gamer.no,"The Last of Us Part II is just as good as the original. The writing is consistently great, making for a dark and deeply emotional story that paves the way for incredible character growth and tons of exciting stealth gameplay. Parts of the game could be more streamlined; looting tends to detract from the moment-to-moment drama; and the environments lack something in terms of variety, but almost everything else is really, really well made.",2020-06-12,90.0

Digital Spy,"The Last of Us 2 is going to be divisive. Naughty Dog has made brave narrative choices for its difficult second album, which we massively respect. We would just have liked to have seen the same applied to the gameplay. It's still solid and thrilling, and if you loved the first game, this is a must-play. It's not as groundbreaking, but equally as heartbreaking.",2020-06-12,80.0
New Game Network,"The Last of Us Part II offers more of the same great stealth gameplay, as you face overwhelming odds in increasingly challenging and haunting environments.

Stevivor,"While Naughty Dog has valiantly tried to accomplish the seemingly impossible, it has fallen short and in doing so revealed the bag of tricks used to exploit our emotions so effectively back in the day. The result is a polished, enjoyable romp that plays superbly but gnaws at the back of your brain in all the wrong ways.",2020-06-12,80.0
GameSpot,"It's a hard game to stomach, in part because so much of who Ellie is and what she does is beyond your control. She is deeply complicated and flawed, and her selfishness hurts a lot of people. At times, the pain you inflict feels so senseless that it can leave you numb. It's all messy and bleak and made me profoundly sad for myriad reasons, but the more I reflect on it, the more I appreciate the story and characters at its core. I wanted almost none of it to happen the way it did, and that's what's both beautiful and devastating about it.",2020-06-12,80.0
Game Revolution,"This excessive padding and theoretically noble attempt to dive into deeper subjects also negatively impacts the gameplay, too, as even its ace combat mechanics can’t quite stay fresh and exciting when repeated that often over the span of 30 hours. What’s left is a Bloater that’s forsaken enough of its soul to only just barely still be recognizable in its current form, shuffling around and proving that, unlike Ellie, it is not immune to devolving into a lesser form of itself.",2020-06-12,70.0
GAMINGbible,"As a video game sequel, it ticks all the boxes of being bigger and better with more to say.

IGN Japan,"The Last of Us Part II tries too hard to differentiate itself from its predecessor. While astonishing cityscapes and more varied combat options are great evolutions, Part II lacks the poetic serenity that made the original road-movie-like epic such a masterpiece. On top of that, uninteresting new characters burden the story, making Ellie's journey feel conventional and not nearly as captivating as the original.",2020-06-12,70.0
